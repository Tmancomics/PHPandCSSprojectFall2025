# PHPandCSSprojectFall2025

I am chosing to do the PHP and CSS combined project. The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic PHP-based e-commerce site with admin backend and customer-facing frontend.

The technologies I have used or will use in the project are:
- HTML5, CSS3
- PHP 
- MySQL
- JavaScript

Set up Instructions:
- Copy the contents of the repository 
- import "database.sql" into MySQL workbench
- Upload repository contents to Georgian Server

I apologize as I have not been consistantly updating this repository with my work.
I am working solo for the project and misunderstood the instructions, I thought the comments on github were just for people working in pairs so they could keep track of eachothers progress. Thats completley my mistake as I have
just been working in PhpStorm and testing with the Georgian server. 
I understand this will affect my grade for phase one of the project, 
through phase two I will make sure to consistantly update this repository with proper comments as I go along.
